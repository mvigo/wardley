    <h1>AI Wardley Map Analysis</h1>
    <p>Wardley Maps are a visualization tool to help understand the current position of various components in a value chain and their evolution over time. In the context of AI, we can use a Wardley Map to represent different AI technologies, techniques, and tools based on their maturity level and the value they provide. Please note that this analysis is a snapshot of the current state of AI as of September 2021, and it may not accurately represent the situation at the time you read it.</p>
    <h2>Wardley Map of AI Landscape</h2>
    <h3>1. Genesis (Emerging Technologies):</h3>
